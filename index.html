            <h1>The Beginning </h1>
            <p>
                My first ever gaming console that I got was a playstation 3 along with black ops <strong> (the first one). </strong> I was aeound 10-12 when I got the PS3 as a gift, so
                I have been gaming for around 8 years. Back then, I would play a lot, and I basically addicted to gaming and could play for hours at a time without getting board.

            <h2>Improvment</h2>
            <p>
                When the PS4 came out, First, my brother got it from my dad, then like 1-2 years later I was able to get it. However, I didn't just get the regular PS4, I got the black ops 3 special PS4.
                I have had it ever since, but the controler had stick drift, so I had to replace it. Anyways, Around these time I was still addicted to gaming and would always come home from school and start playing immediatly.

            <h3>Current Time</h3>
            <p>
                Like I said previously, I still have the same PS4, but I use it way less than before. During all the time before my 16th birthday I had never had a laptop, so when I finally got a laptop
                a lot of my time for gaming was taken and put into the laptop. I also started playing more PC games, so that also made me spend less time using my PS4. I also plan on building my own PC because
                I want to move to playing more PC games, so for the future I will be mainly using a computer and maybe at times I can go back to my PS4.
